Implementation of global variables store file

        1.2. Run 'npm install dotenv --save'
             This will install dotenv library and add entries to package.json files
        1.3. In the root directory of the project create '.env' file
            STRUCTURE OF THE .env FILE
            VARIABLE='Value'
    2. Use global variables in the js spec files
        2.1. at the line 1 add 'require('dotenv').config();'
        2.2. In the test step where you want to parse value, use '.process.env.VARIABLE'
        As a result, the value stored in the variable that is called, will be parsed into the field
